Project of the subject "Programming I" of the Degree in Computer Engineering: Interface for renting bicycles for users
Final grade of the subject: 18/20.

The goal was to develop a program in the C language to assist in the management of bike sharing used for commuting between campuses of the Polytechnic located in Leiria. 

The program records information regarding 15 bicycles, their users, and the loans made. When a user intends to borrow a bicycle, the program indicates the campus that they are at and the campus they want to go to. If there are available bicycles at the origin campus indicated by the user, the loan is immediately processed. Otherwise, the user is placed in a waiting queue. Upon reaching the destination campus, the user returns the bicycle. There are 5 campuses in Leiria: Residences, Campus 1, Campus 2, and Campus 5.
